# What is this project?
This project is an automatic finance trader that will follow what senators are
trading and buy/sell the corresponding stocks. It's merely an experiment to
see how much money one could make through following the stocks being traded
by those in office.

# How is this project getting this data?
After the STOCK act was passed, those in office needed to publish which stocks
were being bought and sold. The website that I am using to scrape this data is
https://www.capitoltrades.com/

# How are the trades illustrated within each row?
For each row (each one represents its own trade), there are the following columns:
    - Politician -- The name of the politician performing the trade
    - Traded Issuer -- The name of the stock or bond being purchased
    - Published -- When the trade was actually released to the public
    - Traded -- When the politician performed the trade
    - Filed After -- How many days after trading was it published
    - Owner -- Who actually owns the stock (Self, Spouse, or Undisclosed)
    - Type -- Whether they bought or sold the stock
    - Size -- The size of trade being sold, which ranges from 1K up to 50M
    - Price -- The price of the stock
---
# How is the columns stored within the actual website?
On the website, each row is stored within a tr header with the class 'q-tr.'
The following is how each column is stored within the website:
    - Politician -- h3 with class 'q-fieldset politician-name' with the name
                    in the preceding a header
    - Traded Issuer -- h3 with class 'q-fieldset issuer-name' with the name
                       in the preceding a header. Additionally, the ticker
                       is stored in span header with class
                       'q-field issuer-ticker'
    - Published -- Within td with class 'q-td q-column--pubDate, the year is
                   stored in a div header with class 'q-label' while the date
                   is stored in a div header with class 'q-value'
    - Traded -- Same as published but td has class 'q-td q-clumn--txDate'
    - Filed After -- Within td with class 'q-td q-column--reportingGap' with
                     the period stored in the div header with 'q-label' while a
                     span header with class 'reporting-gap-tier--1' stores the
                     actual amount of the designated time period 
    - Owner -- Within td with class 'q-td q-column--owner' and stored in the
               span header with 'q-label'
    - Type -- Within td with class 'q-td q-column--txType' and stored in the
              span with class 'q-field tx-type tx-type--sell/buy' where the
              buy/sell is based on the type
    - Size -- Within td with class 'q-td q-column--value' and stored in span
              with class 'q-label' and posted as a range, such as 15KÃ»50K
    - Price -- Within span with class 'q-field trade-price'
